This repository is a WIP on a toolbox to bring robust statistical methods availaible to the scientific community in Python.

It builds upon a custom fork of pymanopt and pyCovariance and add more tools in the general case of robust statistical methods. It also aims to be compatbile with scikit-lean pipelines for ease of use.
